-- COVID19 TIMELINE ANALYSIS USING "Data on COVID-19 (coronavirus) by Our World in Data" dataset
-- WRITTEN IN MICROSOFT SQL SERVER 

-- LOG
  -- Column types are all 'varchar'. Some needed to be changed to numeric type such as 'float' for proper calculation.
  -- Dirty data in continent and location column is fixed by removing continent fields with blank data. Any data related to that blank field is irrelevant/wasted as it leads no      proper conclusion.
  -- ICU/Hospitalized Patient data is not sufficient enough to produce any accurate, unbiased conclusion. 
  -- Insufficient Reproduction rate data
  -- Extreme Poverty data is maybe unclean. It doesn't seem to affect the death rate of a country.
  -- No link can be established between columns. Example - if a smoker is also over 60, is vaccinated or not, did suffer from covid or not.
  -- Final Dataset is selected. 
 

-- FINAL DATASET SELECTION QUERY: 
  -- Column type was altered during analysis.
